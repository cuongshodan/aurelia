# Aurelia - AI-Powered To-Do App

Aurelia is an **AI-driven to-do app** that helps users **transform their goals into actionable SMART tasks**. It guides users through an interactive process of **goal refinement**, ensuring tasks are **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)**. The app also provides analytics to track productivity and improve goal completion rates.

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… AI-Powered Task Refinement

- Converts user input into **SMART** goals.
- Asks **clarifying questions** if details are missing.
- Suggests **more realistic alternatives** for overly ambitious tasks.
- Confirms the final **actionable goal** before saving.

### ðŸ“Š Productivity Tracking & Analytics

- Logs all interactions and task completions.
- Displays **user progress and trends** over time.
- Provides insights into productivity and goal-setting habits.

### ðŸ”— Integration & Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, Express.js, or Encore (Go)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) or MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **State Management:** Redux with TypeScript & Zod validation
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Dockerized setup, Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
- **Payments (Future Feature):** Stripe for premium features

### ðŸ”„ Workflow & Modularity

- **Interactive Refinement:** AI assists users in refining their tasks before adding them.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores user inputs, tasks, and analytics for performance tracking.
- **Extensible Design:** Modular structure for future feature expansion.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. **User inputs a goal.**  
   Example: _"I want to learn AI programming."_
2. **AI refines the goal by asking questions.**  
   Example: _"Which AI programming language? Whatâ€™s your timeline?"_
3. **User finalizes a SMART goal.**  
   Example: _"Complete an online TensorFlow course in 3 months, studying 5 hours per week."_
4. **Goal is saved & tracked for progress.**  
   The app provides **reminders, progress tracking, and insights**.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Roadmap

- **AI-powered voice interactions** for task creation.
- **Collaboration features** for teams and shared goals.
- **Mobile app version** for on-the-go task management.
- **Integration with external tools** (Google Calendar, Notion, etc.).
- **Gamification elements** for motivation and consistency.
